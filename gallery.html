            This is a photo of RZA, the leader of the group Wu-Tang Clan. He is
            doing the Wu-Tang hand sign, and has the outline of the Wu-Tang symbol,
            glowing, over his hands, with text saying Wu-Tang appearing at the
            bottom. I was inspired to make this by seeing an image similar to this
            online, and decided to make my own version.

          This picture is a piece of abstract art I did in my free time.
          I placed triangles on top and under each other in this composition.
          This artwork was inspired by Composition II with Red, Blue and Yellow
          currently being displayed at Kunsthaus ZÃ¼rich, made by Piet Mondrian,
          one of the most famous abstract artists of the 20th century.

          <p>
          The artwork is a version of the Madvillainy album cover I made myself.
          The cover is a photo of MF DOOM wearing his iconic mask.
          This album was made on March 23rd, 2004 by Madvillain, a duo made of
          MF DOOM, easily one of the greatest of all time, and Madlib, a master
          of production. With MF DOOM delivering most of the vocal performances,
          and Madlib producing the entire album, it was bound to be amazing. And
          this album is nothing short of a masterpiece. Everything is incredible.
          The vocals, the flows, the rhyme schemes, the instrumentals, the
          production, the samples, song arrangement, everything is great. And my
          love for the album inspired me to make this.
