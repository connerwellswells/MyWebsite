          <p>
          My name is Conner Wells.
          I go to Licking Heights High School.
          I am a junior.
          I have been going to Licking Heights since kindergarten.

        <h3><b>WHY DID I MAKE THIS?</b></h3>
        <section>
          <p>
          I made this for a project in Web Design, but I feel that it could become much more than that.
          I had always been interested in learning to use HTML and make websites,
          so Web Design seemed like a class I'd like to take. I made this website to make a place that I
          can take what I make in Photoshop, or in any other media other that Photoshop, and put it on the internet.
