<h1><b>ABOUT ME</b></h1>
<section>
<h3><b>BASIC INFO</b></h3>
<p>
My name is Conner Wells, and
I am a junior at Licking Heights.
I have been going to Licking Heights since kindergarten.
I love animals and have always been good with animals, so
I plan on going to college soon after I graduate
to get a <abbr title="Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine">DVM</abbr>, hopefully at Ohio
State University College of Veterinary Medicine.
I currently work at Meijer as a Courtesy Clerk to save money for college.

 <h3><b>WHY DID I MAKE THIS?</b></h3>
  <p>
  I made this for a project in Web Design, but I feel that it could become much more than that.
  I had always been interested in learning to use HTML and make websites,
  so Web Design seemed like a class I'd like to take. I made this website to make a place that I
  can take what I make in Photoshop, or in any other media other that Photoshop, and put it on the internet.
